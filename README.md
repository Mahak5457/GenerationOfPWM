# GenerationOfPWM

Link for Tinkercad Simulation for testing of the generated PWM signals:
https://www.tinkercad.com/things/f5y2gFIMZtZ-incredible-krunk/editel?tenant=circuits

About the simulation: The generated PWM signals are tested by connecting the motor to L293D motor driver and connecting the motor driver further to arduino for input signals.
